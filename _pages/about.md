Nicholas Rossetti is a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Brescia.
Nicholas completed his doctorate in the National PhD in Artificial Intelligence at the Sapienza University of Rome, in collaboration with the University of Brescia, under the supervision of Prof. Alfonso Emilio Gerevini. His research focuses on applying Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and neuro-symbolic AI for automated planning and reasoning. More specifically, his work explores the intersection of learning models, such as LLMs (Large Language Models) and GNNs (Graph Neural Networks), with symbolic components to enhance the reasoning capabilities of these models. In addition, he has contributed to neural model applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) context, particularly in predictive and preventive maintenance and quality control in manufacturing. Prior to his current research, Nicholas worked on Deep Learning applications in medicine, focusing on prognosis, length of stay, and ICU admission for COVID-19 hospitalized patients. His papers have been published in well-known venues, including ICAPS, NeSy, AIxIA, AIME and KES.
