excerpt: 'This paper presents a predictive tool based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to estimate the risk of death for hospitalised COVID-19 patients. The goal is to help hospitals manage limited resourcesâ€”such as ICU beds and ventilators, by identifying high-risk patients in advance. The model uses demographic data, lab test results, and a lung damage severity score from chest X-rays as input features. Trained and tested on data from 2,000 patients in Lombardy, Italy, the system demonstrates strong performance. [paper link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77211-6_36)'

Hospital overloads and limited healthcare resources (ICU beds, ventilators, etc.) are fundamental issues related to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Machine learning techniques can help the hospitals to recognise in advance the patients at risk of death, and consequently to allocate their resources in a more efficient way. In this paper we present a tool based on Recurrent Neural Networks to predict the risk of death for hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The features used in our predictive models consist of demographics information, several laboratory tests, and a score that indicates the severity of the pulmonary damage observed by chest X-ray exams. The networks were trained and tested using data of 2000 patients hospitalised in Lombardy, the region most affected by COVID-19 in Italy. The experimental results show good performance in solving the addressed task. [paper link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-77211-6_36)
