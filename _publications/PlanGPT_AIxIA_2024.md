This paper introduces PlanGPT, a GPT-based model customized for classical planning. PlanGPT is trained from scratch on a dataset of solved planning instances to learn a general policy. Once trained, it can generate solution plans for new problems within the same domain. We enhance the model's performance by incorporating automated planning knowledge into the training process. We evaluate PlanGPT across several planning domains and compare its performance to other deep learning techniques for generalized planning, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
