This paper reviews recent research on using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated planning tasks. In these studies, LLMs are typically given a planning domain along with an initial state and a goal, and asked to generate a sequence of actions (a plan) that solves the problem. While the setup is similar across studies, they vary in the models used, the information provided, whether symbolic planners are used, and how results are evaluated. We summarize the main research trends, notable findings, and current challenges in evaluating LLMsâ€™ planning abilities.
