This paper presents a machine learning system trained on data from over 6,000 hospitalized patients in northern Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The system addresses the challenge of predicting the length of stay for both alive and deceased patients. We introduce a method to handle data from both groups, using information of the outcome of a patient. Additionally, we analyze the most relevant features for predicting the length of stay, providing insights into key factors influencing hospitalization durations.
